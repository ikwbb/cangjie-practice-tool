A web-based tool designed to help users practice and learn the Cangjie input method, a popular Chinese character input system. This project supports both traditional and simplified Chinese characters, with customizable difficulty levels based on character frequency.

## Features

- **Interactive Practice**: Type Cangjie codes to match displayed Chinese characters.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Choose character frequency ranges (1-7072) to adjust practice difficulty.
- **Simplified/Traditional Toggle**: Switch between simplified and traditional Chinese characters.
- **Answer Display**: Show Cangjie codes and graphical breakdowns (for traditional characters) with a button or Enter key.
- **Progress Navigation**: Go back to the previous character using a button or Shift + Backspace.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design with adjustments for mobile devices.
- **Local Storage**: Saves your difficulty and character set preferences.


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ikwbb/cangjie-practice-tool.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cangjie-practice
   ```
3. **Open in Browser**:
   Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No server setup is required as it runs entirely client-side.

   Alternatively, use a local server for better performance:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Select Difficulty**: 
   - Check the boxes in the "Settings and Help" panel to choose character frequency ranges (e.g., 1-500 for beginners, up to 7001-7072 for advanced).
   - At least one range must be selected.

2. **Choose Character Set**: 
   - Toggle the "Use Simplified Characters" checkbox to switch between traditional (default) and simplified Chinese.

3. **Practice**: 
   - A Chinese character appears in the center.
   - Type its Cangjie code in the input box. Correct input advances to the next character automatically.
   - Press `Enter` or click "Ans" to reveal the code and (for traditional characters) a graphical breakdown.

4. **Navigation**: 
   - Click the `<` button or press `Shift + Backspace` to return to the previous character.

5. **Tips**: 
   - Click the `···` button to open the settings and help panel.
